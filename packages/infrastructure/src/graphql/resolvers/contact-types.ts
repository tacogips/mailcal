/** Field resolvers for the contacts types.
 *
 * `AddressBook.mailAddress` and `Contact.addressBook` cross an ownership
 * edge that has no dedicated "get one by id" use case in `ContactUseCases`
 * (only `listAddressBooks`, scoped by mail address) -- unlike
 * `calendarEventResolvers.calendar`, which reaches `ctx.usecases.getCalendar`
 * directly. Both fields instead go through request-scoped loaders that read
 * the repository, exactly like `mailAddressResolvers.domain` ->
 * `ctx.loaders.domainById`: the parent object (`AddressBook`/`Contact`) was
 * already returned by an authorized use case, so re-deriving that same
 * authorization decision here would be redundant, not a safety gap. Every
 * other field is plain property access -- no resolver here reaches past
 * `ctx.loaders`. */

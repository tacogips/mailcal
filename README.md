# mailcal

A self-hosted, multi-domain mail service that runs entirely on Cloudflare
Workers. It receives mail through Cloudflare Email Routing, stores messages
and attachments in D1 + R2, and exposes everything through a single GraphQL
endpoint built for AI agents and programmatic clients as first-class callers
— with a SolidJS browser mail client as a second consumer of the same API.

## What it does

- **Multi-domain.** Add domains, publish the DNS records it prints, verify,
  and mail starts arriving. Unknown recipients are rejected at SMTP time
  rather than black-holed.
- **Scoped API keys.** A key is a list of `(capability, domain,
  addressPattern)` scopes. An agent can be issued a key that may only read
  and reply to `support@example.com`, and nothing else. An unscoped key is
  refused.
- **GraphQL for agents.** One endpoint for domains, messages, threads, tags,
  attachments, file links and key administration.
- **Per-consumer fetch state.** Each API key has its own
  `NOT_FETCHED`/`FETCHED` queue, so two agents polling the same mailbox each
  see every message exactly once. Acknowledgment is idempotent.
- **Temp file links.** Mint a short-lived, credential-free HTTPS URL for an
  attachment or a raw `.eml`, with an expiry and an optional download cap —
  so an agent can hand a plain link to a tool or a person without handing
  over its key.
- **Tagging, with a reserved spam tag.** User tags plus four system tags
  addressed by slug. Inbound mail is scored on explainable signals (SPF/DKIM/
  DMARC results, envelope-vs-header sender mismatch, phrase and blocklists)
  and auto-tagged `SPAM`; spam is hidden from default listings.
- **Browser mail client.** `mailcal client serve` serves the SolidJS client
  locally against any deployment. HTML mail is sanitized *and* rendered in a
  sandboxed iframe, with remote images blocked until the reader opts in.

## Layout

| Package | Responsibility |
|---------|----------------|
| `packages/domain` | Entities, branded value objects, invariants |
| `packages/application` | Ports, use cases, authorization policy |
| `packages/adapter` | D1/libsql, R2/S3/memory, WebCrypto, MIME, repositories |
| `packages/infrastructure` | GraphQL schema/resolvers, hono app, composition root |
| `apps/api` | Worker (`fetch` + `email`), migrations, local Bun/Node server |
| `apps/web` | SolidJS mail client |
| `apps/cli` | The `mailcal` CLI, including `client serve` |

The dependency rule points inward: `domain` depends on nothing, and no inner
layer imports an outer one.

## Getting started

```bash
mise install && bun install
mise run dev          # local API (libsql + in-memory blobs) and the web client
mise run ci           # lint, typecheck, tests, build
```

The local server applies every pending migration and seeds the system tags
before serving a single request, so a clean checkout runs immediately. It
also exposes a dev-only `POST /dev/inbound?from=&to=` route that feeds a raw
`.eml` through the identical ingest pipeline the Worker uses — local
development has no SMTP path.

## Deployed instance

This repository is deployed at **https://mailcal-api.tacotest.workers.dev**
(Cloudflare account `me+cloudflare@tacogips.me`), backed by the `mailcal-db`
D1 database and the `mailcal-mail` R2 bucket, with both migrations applied.

It is bootstrapped and idle: no mail domain is configured yet, so nothing is
being received or sent. Add one with `mailcal domain add <name>` (or the
settings UI), publish the DNS records it prints, then enable Email Routing on
that domain in the Cloudflare dashboard with a catch-all rule targeting the
`mailcal-api` Worker.

## Deploying

See `design-docs/specs/design-deployment.md` for the full bring-up order.
In short: create the D1 database and R2 bucket, `mise run cf-deploy`, enable
Email Routing on your domain with a catch-all rule targeting the Worker,
verify the domain for sending, then add the domain in mailcal itself.

A **Workers Paid plan** is required.

## Bootstrapping a fresh deployment

A deployed Worker has no shell, and passwordless login needs a verified
sending domain that only an authenticated admin can add. `bootstrapAdmin`
therefore returns a full-capability API key along with the user. It succeeds
only while the instance has no users at all, and closes permanently after
one call.

```bash
curl -sX POST https://<worker-host>/graphql \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"query":"mutation { bootstrapAdmin(email: \"you@example.com\", name: \"You\") { secret apiKey { keyPrefix } } }"}'
```

Store that secret — it is shown once. Revoke it once you have issued
narrowly scoped keys for your agents.

## Agent quick start

```graphql
# Poll
query { messages(filter: { fetchStatus: NOT_FETCHED, direction: INBOUND }, first: 20) {
  nodes { id subject from { address } snippet attachments { id fileName } }
  nextCursor
} }

# Acknowledge
mutation($ids: [ID!]!) { markMessagesFetched(messageIds: $ids) { id fetchStatus } }
```

Or from the shell:

```bash
mailcal mail fetch --ack --watch --interval 30
```
